\description{
This is the data set called `DETROIT' in the book `Subset selection in
regression' by Alan J. Miller published in the Chapman & Hall series of
monographs on Statistics & Applied Probability, no. 40.   The data are
unusual in that a subset of three predictors can be found which gives a
very much better fit to the data than the subsets found from the Efroymson
stepwise algorithm, or from forward selection or backward elimination.
The original data were given in appendix A of `Regression analysis and its
application: A data-oriented approach' by Gunst & Mason, Statistics
textbooks and monographs no. 24, Marcel Dekker.   It has caused problems
because some copies of the Gunst & Mason book do not contain all of the data,
and because Miller does not say which variables he used as predictors and
which is the dependent variable.   (HOM was the dependent variable, and the
predictors were FTP ... WE)
